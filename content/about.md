I'm Kenneth. Here's a list of title I would describe myself:

* ~ A Hongkonger
* ~ A mapmaker
* ~ An urbanist
* ~ A data analyst specialised on urban analytics/spatial data science

The tools in my analysis toolbox are usually `Geographic Information System (GIS)`, `R` and `Python`.

My full personal website and portfolio is in https://kennethwong12.netlify.app/.

## Some Q&A

### What does the website name mean?

> **Cities, Data, Maps.**  
> Palette, Pigments, Paintings.

I always perceive myself as an urbanist. I love the metropolitan lifestyle and randomly wandering across the alleyways and small streets in the town.

I am also a map nerd. I love reading and collecting maps since my childhood. I never thought of making maps as a profession until the first time I tried GIS.

I love maths and statistics, even though I actually suck at it. Wrangling data is one of my useless hobbies.

So, yea, the website name comes from the three things I love most. And I just use the term *palette* to make things a little bit sexier (hope it does).
