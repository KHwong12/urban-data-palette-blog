I like maps, data analysis and visualisation. I like to understand our cities through the above the tools. I am trained as an urban planner, while I strongly believe data and maps help to shape our cities into better places.

I am committed to bring GIS, maps and data to the urban planning field. Currently indulged in developing maps and applications that could act as planning support tools.

My full portfolio and personal website is in https://kennethwong12.netlify.app/.

## About this website

### Where does the website name comes from?

> **Cities, Data, Maps.**  
> Palette, Pigments, Paintings.

I always perceive myself as an urbanist. I love metropolitan lifestyle. I love randomly wandering across the alleyways and small streets in the town. I believe urban is a good place to stay in.

I am also a map nerd. I love reading and collecting maps since my childhood. I never thought of making maps as a profession until the first time I tried GIS.

I love maths and statistics, even though I actually bad at it. I thought I am good at maths during primary and secondary school, yet in the end I found myself an "better-than-average" person.

So, yea, the website name comes from the three things I love most. And I just use the term *palette* to make things a little bit sexier (hope it does).
