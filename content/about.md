I am currently a research assistant at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). I hold an M.Sc in Urban Planning and B.A. in Urban Studies from HKU. I am currently responsible for spatial data manipulation, analysis and visualisation tasks for various urban planning/analytics projects. The end products are mostly maps and charts, in the form of [academic paper](https://doi.org/10.1177/2399808320932575), [blog articles](https://medium.com/@khwongk12/double-ageing-mapped-9509a410d20b?source=friends_link&sk=94ab295e3d8a8c0d7fcc460998abcec6), [interactive web applications](https://khwong12.github.io/HK_Peaks/) and [static maps and gifs](https://github.com/KHwong12/dataviz).

The major tools I use are `Geographic Information System (GIS)`, `R` and `Python`. Data-driven analysis and visualisations, both spatial and non-spatial, always fascinate me. With my background in urban planning, I analyse and write about urban and cities, throwing the light on spatial/urban data science.

## Some Q&A

### What does the website name mean?

> **Cities, Data, Maps.**  
> Palette, Pigments, Paintings.

I always perceive myself as an urbanist. I love the metropolitan lifestyle and randomly wandering across the alleyways and small streets in the town.  
I am also a map nerd. I love reading and collecting maps since my childhood. I never thought of making maps as a profession until the first time I tried GIS.  
I love maths and statistics, even though I actually suck at it. Wrangling data is probably one of my useless hobbies.

So, yea, the website name comes from the three things I love most. And I just use the term *palette* to make things a little bit sexier (Hope it was).
